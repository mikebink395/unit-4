# Unit-4-Project-OOP-Game-Show

This web page allows a user to play hangman with 5 lives and use either the keyboard or click buttons on an on-screen keybaord. There are three classes: Phrase, Game, and app. Phrase creates and sets up a phrase that the user must guess by choosing letters that he/she thinks would be in the word. Game controls the game logic, for example counting how many lives the user still has. App runs the game, sets the phrase, and resents the game when the user wants to start a new game. 

## Usage

Use this thing if you enjoy playing hangman, watching wheel of fortue, guessing letters, losing lives, winning, losing, and slowly fading in animations of Peter Griffin. 

This Webpage uses dynamic DOM scripting to run the features of a hangman game.
